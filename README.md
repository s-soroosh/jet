Jetto Web Framework
========

Jetto is a simple and opinionated web framework based on express.js! setings up a new endpoint/resource is as simple as creating a new pure typescript class.
See [example.ts](./example.ts) for an example.

At the time being Jetto is actively under development and subject to change significantly.
